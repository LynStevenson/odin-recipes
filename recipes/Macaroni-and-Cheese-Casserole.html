    <p>A wonderful dish that is easy to make and something your whole family will love! A cheesy delight that I enjoyed

    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) package fully cooked kielbasa sausage, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) package elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>â…“ cup butter</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>1 (10 ounce) package sharp Cheddar cheese, cubed</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup dry bread crumbs, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Cook and stir the cut-up kielbasa in a large skillet over medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes,<br>
            until heated through and beginning to brown. Remove the sausage from the skillet, and set aside</li>
        <li>Fill a pan with lightly salted water, bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stir in the macaroni,<br>
            and return to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still firm to the bite,<br>
            about 8 minutes. Drain well.</li>
        <li>Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</li>
        <li>Melt the butter in the skillet over medium-low heat, and cook and stir the chopped onion for about 5 minutes,<br>
            until translucent. Whisk in the flour, stirring constantly to avoid lumps. Cook and stir the butter,<br>
            onion and flour for 2 to 3 minutes to make a roux, and remove from the heat. Whisk in the milk a little at a time,<br>
            stirring constantly, until all the milk has been incorporated, and return to low heat. Bring the sauce to a simmer,<br>
            and cook over low heat for about 2 minutes, stirring constantly, to finish cooking the flour.<br>
            Whisk in the Cheddar cheese, a few cubes at a time, until all the cheese has been incorporated and the sauce is hot and smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the macaroni into the cheese sauce, and stir to combine. Stir in the cooked kielbasa, salt, and pepper.</li>
        <li>Spoon the macaroni mixture into the prepared baking dish, and sprinkle the bread crumbs over the top.<br>
            Bake for about 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until the crumbs are brown and the casserole is bubbling.<br>
            Let stand for 15 minutes after baking, to set before serving.</li>
    </ol>
